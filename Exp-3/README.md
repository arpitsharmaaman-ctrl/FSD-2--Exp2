# SPA Experiment – React + Vite

## Objective

To design and develop a basic Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern frontend framework and understand client-side rendering.

## Aim

To implement routing and component-based architecture in a Single Page Application using React and Vite.

## Description

This project is a basic Single Page Application built using **React** and **Vite**. The application includes multiple views such as Home, About, Contact, and SPA, which are rendered dynamically without reloading the browser. Navigation happens on the client side, giving a smooth and fast user experience.

The project follows a component-based architecture and is deployed on **Netlify** for public access.

## Technologies Used

* React.js
* Vite
* JavaScript (ES6)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* GitHub (Version Control)
* Netlify (Deployment)

## Software and Hardware Requirements

**Software Requirements:**

* Node.js
* npm
* React
* Vite
* Code Editor (VS Code)
* Web Browser (Chrome / Edge)

**Hardware Requirements:**

* Minimum 4 GB RAM
* Any modern computer or laptop

## Project Structure

* `Home.jsx` – Home page component
* `About.jsx` – About page component
* `Contact.jsx` – Contact page component
* `Spa.jsx` – SPA content component
* `main.jsx` – Application entry point

## Algorithm / Procedure

1. Install Node.js and npm on the system.
2. Create a new React project using Vite.
3. Install required dependencies such as react-router-dom.
4. Create separate components for Home, About, Contact, and SPA pages.
5. Configure routing using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.
6. Add navigation links for smooth client-side navigation.
7. Style components using CSS for responsiveness.
8. Test the application locally using the Vite development server.
9. Build the project for production.
10. Deploy the project on Netlify.

## Features

* Single Page Application architecture
* Component-based UI design
* Fast build and rendering using Vite
* Smooth navigation without page reload
* Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Output

The application successfully renders different pages without reloading the browser. Navigation between components is fast and smooth, demonstrating the working of a Single Page Application.

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Netlify.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this experiment, I gained a clear understanding of:

* The concept and working of Single Page Applications
* Creating and reusing components in React
* Client-side rendering and routing basics
* Setting up projects using Vite
* Standard folder structure for React applications
* Deploying frontend applications on Netlify
* Using GitHub for version control and documentation

## Conclusion

This experiment helped me understand modern frontend development using React and highlighted the benefits of Single Page Applications over traditional multi-page websites, especially in terms of performance and user experience.
